            <h1>Tencent and China's Crypto Revolution</h1>
            <h4>This is a research oriented blog that I wrote for a client.</h4>
            <p>Tencent, founded in 1998, is the world's largest video game vendor, as well as one of the most financially valuable companies in the world. Mostly operating in China, its subsidiaries include the instant messengers Tencent QQ and WeChat, and one of the largest web portals, QQ.com.</p>

            <p>     The company surpassed a market value of US$500 billion in 2018, becoming the first Asian technology company to cross this valuation mark. Recently however, at approximately $1 trillion, Bitcoin’s market cap has blown past Tencent, which holds a valuation of roughly $917.8 billion. This is not the only front where Tencent is competing with bitcoin. Tencent along with other large chinense fintech companies and banks will launch a state-backed cryptocurrency and issue it to seven institutions in the coming months.</p>
            <p>China’s Digital Yuan will replace its physical currency and the project goes by the name Digital Currency Electronics Payment (DCEP). MYbank and WeBank – institutions backed by Chinese giants Ant Group and Tencent, respectively – are reportedly set to join the ongoing trial of the digital yuan. Digital wallets from the two private banks will be added to the People's Bank of China’s (PBOC) digital yuan app alongside those from the six state-owned banks already participating. 

                These however are not recent advances. The PBOC has been working with these firms on its digital yuan programme since 2014, though it released few details until last year. Similarly, Tencent has gradually increased its exposure to blockchain and crypto and continues to do so.</p>
            <p>#The Chinese Blockchain Consortium

                - Tencent's first significant involvement in blockchain can be traced back to 2016 when Chinese financial services firm "Ping An" Bank and Tencent were among more than 30 technology and financial firms in China that formed a new consortium dedicated to blockchain tech.
                - The Financial Blockchain Shenzhen Consortium was officially launched on 31st May 2016 during an event in Shenzhen. Areas of focus among its membership included capital markets technology, securities exchange, trading platforms, life insurance and banking – areas with potential for applying blockchain tech.</p>
            <p>#Blockchain as a Service - 🈸

                - Fast forward to 2017 - Tencent started building a suite of blockchain services, detailing the plans in a new whitepaper. The plan was to use the technology to offer digital asset management, authentication and “shared economies”, among others services.
                - The platform was named “TrustSQL”. Envisioned as a three-part system, incorporating the core chain layer, a product and service layer, and an application layer, TrustSQL is a BaaS platfrom under construction.
                - The BaaS platform is designed to provide all the tools necessary for developing blockchain applications.</p>
            <p>#Blockchain Research Institute - 🏛️

                - In October, A Canada-based blockchain research effort added over a dozen members including Tencent and FedEx, and the Ontario Ministry of Health.
                - The Blockchain Research Institute, founded in March by Don and Alex Tapscott, and backed by a group companies like IBM and PepsiCo, aimed to serve as a hub for academic research around the technology. The institute went on to partner with new members including Deloitte Canada, the Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation (DTCC), Fujitsu, telecom provider Bell Canada and gold mining giant Barrick Gold.
                - Tencent’s blockchain lead, Ray Guo, said: “Blockchain Research Institute provides a great platform for Tencent and other members of the institute to carry out blockchain research and discussion, which is of great significance to Tencent and the industry. We believe that the blockchain+ era is coming!”</p>
            <p>#Blockchain for Faster Corporate Expense Refunds - 💴

                - In Aug, Tencent piloted an application at a local restaurant in Shenzhen, China, where a user paid the bill through its existing payments service WeChat Pay. The idea was to use blockchain to speed up the reimbursement of expenses for company employees.
                - By feeding the payment data over its blockchain platform to the user’s employer, delays normally encountered via the standard manual claims process were eliminated. The company wants to streamline and hasten the expense reimbursement process, while also reducing the prevalence of falsified receipts.
                - Currently, China employs a somewhat complex system whereby merchants issue different payment receipts for individuals and firms. When staff need to be reimbursed for dining expenses, for instance, they must request a receipt for companies listing the exact taxpayer number of their employer. In order to do that, employees need to have the merchant manually type in the taxpayer number on the receipt in every instance. Furthermore, that process is typically followed by additional manual tasks, such as collecting receipts and filing a claim before they can receive a refund.</p>

                <p>#Blockchain to fight Tax Evasion - 💰

                    - In May 2018, Tencent partnered with the tax authority of the city of Shenzhen to use blockchain in the fight against tax evasion.
                    - They jointly set up an “Intelligent Tax” innovation lab, that aimed to promote technological innovation around taxation processes.</p>
                <p>#Blockchain-Based Virtual Bank - 🏦

                    - By the end of 2019 - Nov - Yige Cai announced that Hong Kong Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) approved a new license for Tencent to open a blockchain-based virtual bank.
                    - The SFC granted virtual bank licences to 12 entities. On the list was Infinium Limited, a joint venture between Tencent, Industrial and Commerce Bank of China (ICBC) and other two Hong Kong-based institutional investors. Tencent renamed Infinium to Fusion Bank in July after it received the license in May.</p>
                <p>#Website for Global Devs - 👩‍💻

                    - The Blockchain-Based Service Network (a Chinese state-sanctioned blockchain infrastructure project, as mentioned earlier) launched its English-language website for international decentralized applications (dapp) developers.
                    - Developers are now able to build dapps and run nodes on either permissioned blockchains or major public chains through the global version of the network.</p>
                <p>#The Future - 👨‍❤️‍💋‍👨

                    As if the love of Tencent for blockchain and crypto was not evident, the technology giant will be  pouring $70B into new tech including blockchain. In an interview with state media, Dowson Tong, Tencent’s senior executive vice president, confirmed the company had also earmarked investment for sectors such as cloud computing, artificial intelligence and cybersecurity. It isn’t clear how much of the $70 billion investment Tencent will ultimately set aside for blockchain.</p>
